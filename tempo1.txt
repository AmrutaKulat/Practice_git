Can I get a count for the following tech

Kubernetes 
Anaconda 
MapR
Cloudera
TensorFlow
PyTorch


If any of the techs don't exist that's fine just omit them. Give me count and sample of 100 companies with full records (no nulls in any field)

I want is companies that are using all the tech, then 5 techs and 4 and so on

The idea is any company that is using most of the tech then they would be a good target, as Cisco C480 ML box has all tech embedded in it.
